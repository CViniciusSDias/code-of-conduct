## Introduction

This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by PHPRio, including online services as Telegram, IRC, all public and private mailing lists, issue trackers, wikis, blogs, Twitter, and any other communication channel used by our communities.

We expect this code of conduct to be honored by everyone who participates in the PHPRio community formally or informally, or claims any affiliation with the community, in any community-related activities.

This code is not complete, feel encouraged to participate. Just remember to maintain the code very concise and broad, our goal is to create a prolific community where everyone can feel good, grow as a person and help others.

## Expected Behavior

- Be responsible - each action builds the environment that you want to live.
- Be welcoming, kind, emphatetic - Working together to resolve conflict and do our best to act in an empathetic way.
We may all experience some frustration from time to time, but we do not allow frustration to turn into a personal attack.
A community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.
We should be respectful when dealing with other community members as well as with people outside our community.
- Be collaborative - The community was born by collaboration, people that want to help others by their skills.
Without collaboration spirit, no initiative will prosper. Don't **use** the community, participate and grow together.
- Be respectful of other viewpoints and ideas - 
- Be supportive and look out for each other.

- Offensive, inappropriate, or unwanted comments - when someone asks to stop, stop.

- Sustained disruption of talks or other events
- Intimidation or bullying (online or in-person)
- SPAM - the act of sending marketing oriented posts without context or even approval from the admins is considered spamming
- Flood - the act of inundate a source of interaction with messages of your own is considered flooding
